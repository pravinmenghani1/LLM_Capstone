## üéØ **WORKFLOW 1: CUSTOMER SUPPORT AUTOMATION**

### **Step 1: Set Up the Trigger**
```
TRIGGER: New Support Ticket
- Platform: Email (Gmail/Outlook) OR Support System (Zendesk/Freshdesk)
- What it watches: New emails to support@ecotech.com
- When it fires: Immediately when new ticket arrives
```

### **Step 2: Extract Ticket Information**
```
ACTION: Parse Email Content
- Extract: Customer email, subject line, message body
- Store in variables:
  - customer_email = "john@example.com"
  - ticket_subject = "Device stopped working"
  - ticket_body = "My AquaPure Solar stopped working after 2 weeks..."
```

### **Step 3: Analyze Sentiment**
```
ACTION: ChatGPT API Call
Prompt: "Analyze the sentiment of this customer support ticket. 
Provide sentiment score (0.0-1.0) and emotion:

Subject: {{ticket_subject}}
Message: {{ticket_body}}

Return format: Score: X.X, Emotion: [emotion], Urgency: [low/medium/high]"

Expected Output: "Score: 0.2, Emotion: Frustrated, Urgency: high"
```

### **Step 4: Categorize Issue Type**
```
ACTION: ChatGPT API Call
Prompt: "Categorize this support ticket into one category:

Categories: TECHNICAL, BILLING, SHIPPING, GENERAL

Ticket: {{ticket_subject}} - {{ticket_body}}

Return only the category name."

Expected Output: "TECHNICAL"
```

### **Step 5: Set Priority Level**
```
ACTION: Zapier Code (Python)
def determine_priority(sentiment_score, category, urgency):
    if sentiment_score < 0.3 and category == "TECHNICAL":
        return "URGENT"
    elif sentiment_score < 0.4 or urgency == "high":
        return "HIGH"
    elif category in ["BILLING", "SHIPPING"]:
        return "MEDIUM"
    else:
        return "LOW"

priority = determine_priority({{sentiment_score}}, {{category}}, {{urgency}})
```

### **Step 6: Route to Appropriate Team**
```
ACTION: Conditional Logic
IF category == "TECHNICAL" AND priority == "URGENT":
    ‚Üí Send to: tech-urgent@ecotech.com
