**For Automation:**
"This single workflow replaces 6 manual tasks that would take hours each week."

## Making It Even More Interactive

### Add Real API Calls (Level 400):
```python
# Replace simulated content with real API calls
import openai

def real_chatgpt_translation(text, target_language):
    response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
        model="gpt-4",
        messages=[{
            "role": "user", 
            "content": f"Translate this to {target_language}: {text}"
        }]
    )
    return response.choices[0].message.content
```
