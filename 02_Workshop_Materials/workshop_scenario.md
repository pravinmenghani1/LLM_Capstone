Team,

We have a MAJOR crisis. Our AquaPure Solar launch in 5 countries is happening 
TODAY at 2 PM, but our marketing agency just canceled due to a data breach.

We need to:
1. Create product content in 5 languages (English, Spanish, Japanese, German, Hindi)
2. Analyze 50+ customer reviews from beta testing
3. Set up automated customer support workflows
4. Validate all our product data for consistency
5. Create professional profiles for our international sales team

We have 4 HOURS to make this happen or we lose $2M in pre-orders.

Your mission: Use AI tools to save our launch.

- Sarah
